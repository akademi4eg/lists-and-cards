Lists and Cards
===============

Simple application assisting in learning foreign words.

Main features:
* words are grouped in lists
* custom lists creation
* language pairs in lists can be switched
* freestyle: brief overview of the list (can be used for selfcontrol)
* writing: given word in one language you need to write its translation
* basic internationalization (Russian and English interfaces available)

Note on translations.
By default current locale is used to get proper translation. You can change translation by passing locale in arguments.
For example, for en_US locale call:
java -jar lac-0.5.0.jar en US
If needed, new translations can be added to i18n folder. Format is pretty straightforward.

P.S. It initially has been written for my mom, so don't expect to much functionality from this app. ;)
